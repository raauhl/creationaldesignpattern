This pattern is used when we need only one instance of a class. The only way to create object
is by using the class constructor to make a new object. Making the constructor private
prohibit to create object for that class.

Then we make another public method inside the class say "getInstance()" which returns the
object for this class. The catch is calling getInstance always returns the same object.
i.e only a single instance of the class exist in the system and only way to get that instance
is via getInstance method inside that class.
