The idea is when you have to create a family of products and that family can vary
across a type. So let's say we have a {Chair, Sofa, Table} now this family can vary
among style type which can be -> Modern, Archaic, Plastic.


So first of we define an interface for each product, so a chair can be ModernChair, ArchaicChar
Plastic chair and similarly for other prdocuts.

Also now we have a abstractFactory class, which have three methods to get this family.
Lets say getChair(), getSofa() and getTable() now we let have create three variants
for this abstract factory of type modern, archain and plastic and then client can use
based on its config any variant of this.
