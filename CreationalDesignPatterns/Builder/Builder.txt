This pattern is used when a object has to be created but there might be
several different ways to construct that object. So let's say object might
have 7 different parameters in the constructor.

So we might have to add different overloaded parameters or default values etc.
This is an anti-pattern called telescoping constructor.

The solution is to use a builder object to create the object.

So for example lets say,
We have a interface aircraft and two variants of it - figher and passenger.
We know that there are common steps to create an aircarft across these two
variants of aircraft or a base aircraft in general.

Let's say cockpit, bathrooms, wings, engines.
