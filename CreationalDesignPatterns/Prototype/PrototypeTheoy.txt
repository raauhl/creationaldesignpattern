Let's you copy existing object without making code dependent of their classes.

Generic way is to create a new object and copy all the values of class variables.
Not always possible since values might be private and in order to create object
client need to know the needed object's class, creating a dependency.

Use a interface with a single clone method and let the object are needed to be clones
implement it.
